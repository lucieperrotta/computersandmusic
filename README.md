This repository is part of the EPFL Master's course *Computers and Music* taught during the fall semester. It contains the following notebooks:

- **Synthesizer**: 3 implementations of oscillators (digital, additive, and FM), and LFO modulation.
- **PitchScalingAndTimeStretching**: Methods for independently changing the pitch and length of an audio signal.
- **ChannelVocoder**: A vocoder combining a carrier synthesizer with a modulator voice.
- **Reverb**: Artificial acoustic reverberation built from FIR and IIR filters.
- **Equalizer**: An audio EQ composed of 3 types of frequency filters (notch, cut, and shelf).
- **Compressor**: A dynamic range compressor controlled by threshold, ratio, knee with, makeup, attack, and release.
- **NonlinearModelling**: Methods for modelling and identifying dynamic nonlinear systems such as amplifiers.
- **Helpers**: A notebook with helpers functions for the others notebooks, along with examples and explanations.

The *requirements.txt* file contains the libraries needed for running the code.
